Installation Instructions:

Get the executables from:
https://eclectic-kitty.itch.io/the-stranger

Linux: Just make sure the permissions on the file are set to be executable by anyone, and run the file

Windows: Just run the .exe

MacOS: Double click on the .zip file and it should extract a The Stranger.app file. Double click on this, and hopefully the game will run.

Unfortunately, I am not a verified Mac Developer so in order to run the game, you may have to run the following command in a terminal after extracting the .app from the zip file: 

sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Downloads/The\ Stranger.app

"/Downloads/The\ Stranger.app" should be replaced with the path to the .app if you've put it somewhere else.
